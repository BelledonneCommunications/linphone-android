			   LINPHONE for ANDROID
			****************************

To build liblinphone for Android, you must:
0) download the Android sdk with platform-tools and tools updated to latest revision (at least API 16 is needed), then add both 'tools' and 'platform-tools' folders in your path.
1) download the Android ndk (>=r8b) from google and add it to your path.
2) install the autotools: autoconf, automake, aclocal, libtoolize, pkgconfig
2bis) on some 64 bits systems you'll need the ia32-libs package
3) run the Makefile script in the top level directory. This will download iLBC source files and convert some assembly files in VP8 project.
	$ make
4) To install the generated apk into a plugged device, run
	$ make install

To run the tutorials:
1) open the res/values/non_localizable_custom.xml file and change the value of the show_tutorials_instead_of_app to true.
2) compile again using make && make install.
3) /!\ don't forget to put it back to false to run the linphone application normally. /!\

To create an apk with a different package name, you need to edit the custom_rules.xml file:
1) look for the property named "linphone.package.name" and change it value accordingly
2) run again the Makefile script by calling "make"

Some options can be passed to make, like "make SOME_OPTION=SOME_VALUE".
